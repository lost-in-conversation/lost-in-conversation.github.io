There are many people named Bill. We also don't know his birth year.\n\n3.  **Provide information about Comet Halley:** Comet Halley is a periodic comet, visible from Earth approximately every 75-76 years. Its most recent appearances were:\n    *   **1986**\n    *   **1910**\n    *   Before that: 1835, 1758-59, etc.\n\n4.  **Explain how to calculate the age:** Once we know Bill's birth year and the year he *first* saw the comet, we can calculate his age:\n    *   Age = (Year Comet Seen) - (Year Bill Was Born)\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since we don't know who \"Bill\" is or when he was born, we cannot determine his age when he first saw Comet Halley.\n\n**To answer the question, please provide Bill's year of birth.**\n\n**Example:**\n*   If Bill was born in **1970**, he would have likely first seen Comet Halley in **1986**.

If Bill was born in 1970, he was 16 in 1986. If he was born in 1980, he was 6 in 1986.\n    *   **Conclusion for Scenario 1:** We know Bill first saw the comet in 1986, but we can't determine his age without his birth year.\n\n3.  **Scenario 2: Dad saw Comet Halley in 1910.**\n    *   If the dad was 30 in 1910, he was born in 1910 - 30 = **1880**.\n    *   Bill would have been born *after* 1880 (likely many years after).\n    *   When would Bill have *first* seen Comet Halley?\n        *   He might have seen it in **1910** (if he was born between, say, 1890 and 1910). In this case, his dad was 30. Bill's age would be 1910 - (Bill's birth year). We don't know Bill's birth year.\n        *   He might have missed the 1910 sighting (e.g., too young or not born yet) and seen it for the first time in **1986**.

The actual period varies slightly, but 75 years is a good average. The last two appearances were 1910 and 1986 (a gap of 76 years).\n2.  **Relevance to the Problem:** This information reinforces the likely years we've been considering for when Bill or his dad might have seen the comet (primarily 1910 and 1986).\n3.  **Does it Solve the Problem?** No. While it confirms the timing of the comet's return, it doesn't tell us anything specific about Bill or his dad's birth years, or which specific appearance they witnessed.\n4.  **Current Situation:** We still have the same two main possibilities based on when the dad saw the comet at age 30:\n    *   **Scenario A:** Dad saw it in 1986 (born 1956). Bill saw it first in 1986. We don't know Bill's age.\n    *   **Scenario B:** Dad saw it in 1910 (born 1880). Bill might have seen it first in 1910 or 1986. We don't know Bill's age.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe fact that Comet Halley has a ~75-year orbit is consistent with the appearances in 1910 and 1986, but it doesn't help us determine Bill's age when he *first* saw it.

Given the ~76-year gap between recent appearances (1910 and 1986), these must be the two sightings Bill experienced.\n    *   Therefore:\n        *   Bill's *first* sighting was in **1910**.\n        *   Bill's *second* sighting was in **1986**.\n\n4.  **Confirm Bill's Age at Second Sighting:**\n    *   We established Bill was 90 years old at his second sighting.\n    *   This means Bill was 90 years old in **1986**.\n\n5.  **Calculate Bill's Birth Year:**\n    *   If Bill was 90 years old in 1986, he was born in: 1986 - 90 = **1896**.\n\n6.  **Determine When the Dad Saw the Comet:**\n    *   We know the dad was 30 when he saw it. Could he have seen it in 1986 or 1910?\n    *   *Scenario 1: Dad saw it in 1986.* If he was 30 in 1986, he was born in 1986 - 30 = 1956.\n    *   *Scenario 2: Dad saw it in 1910.* If he was 30 in 1910, he was born in 1910 - 30 = 1880.\n    *   Now, compare this with Bill's birth year (1896):\n        *   If the dad was born in 1956, Bill (born 1896) would be much older than his dad. This is impossible.\n        *   If the dad was born in 1880, Bill was born in 1896. This means the dad was 16 when Bill was born, which is biologically possible.\n    *   Therefore, the dad must have seen the comet in **1910** when he was 30 (having been born in 1880).\n\n7.  **Calculate Bill's Age at His FIRST Sighting:**\n    *   Bill's *first* sighting was in **1910**.\n    *   Bill was born in **1896**.\n    *   Bill's age in 1910 = 1910 - 1896 = **14 years old**.\n\n**Answer:** Bill was **14 years old** when he first saw Comet Halley (in 1910).", "timestamp": "2025-04-04 21:11:44", "cost_usd": 0.0229025}, {"role": "log", "content": {"type": "system-verification", "response": {"response_type": "answer_attempt"}}, "timestamp": "2025-04-04 21:11:44", "cost_usd": 0.0}, {"role": "log", "content": {"type": "answer-evaluation", "exact_answer": "14", "is_correct": null, "score": 0.0, "evaluation_return": {"score": 0.0}}, "timestamp": "2025-04-04 21:11:45"}], "is_correct": null, "score": 0.0}

The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that *all* students are included in the result, even those who don't have any pets (they will have a count of 0). The join condition `ON T1.StuID = T2.StuID` links students to their pet records.\n3.  `GROUP BY T1.StuID, T1.Fname, T1.LName`: This groups the rows based on the student's ID, first name, and last name. The `count(T2.PetID)` function then counts the number of pets within each unique student group.\n\nThis query will give you a list of all students and how many pets each one owns.
